# **App Name**: EthDeploy

## Core Features:

- Wallet Connection: Connect to MetaMask wallet for secure contract deployment.
- Solidity Input: Input field for pasting Solidity (.sol) code.
- Code Compilation: Compile the Solidity code using solc-js directly in the browser.
- ABI Display: Display the contract's ABI in a copyable output box.
- Bytecode Display: Display the contract's bytecode in a copyable output box.
- Contract Deployment: Deploy the compiled contract to the blockchain using MetaMask.
- Contract Address Display: Display the deployed contract address after successful deployment.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric purple (#BE29EC) to evoke blockchain tech vibe.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEF0), almost white, providing a clean backdrop that doesn't distract from the primary content.
- Accent color: Soft blue (#52A7FF) for interactive elements such as buttons.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for displaying ABI and Bytecode.
- Use simple, geometric icons to represent blockchain-related actions (e.g., deploy, connect).
- Use a grid-based layout for clear content organization.
- Subtle animations on button hovers and transitions to provide feedback and engagement.
